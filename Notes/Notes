Package.json - It is a configuration for npm. It keeps a tracking what version it is installed.
Package.lock.json : Keeps a track of the exact version
NPM - It is a package managaer and it will manage all the packages and install in our system. Sometimes  It doesn't have full form
Dependency :  Dev (Development phase, when we are developing it required dev dependency) and normal (Used in production also)
 "devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.13.2" - '^' If we use '^' when we get minor update it will install that 
                          '~' If we use '~' when we get major update it will install that

HMR - Hot Module Replacement
      It means that parcel will keep a track of all the files which you are updating.
      Parcel is a File Watching Algorithm (written in C++) - Automatically it is running when we save

Parcel-cache:
            Parcel caches code all the time.
            When we run the application, a build is created which takes some time in ms.
            If we make any code changes and save the application, another build will be triggered which might take even less time than the previous build.
            This reduction of time is due to parcel cache.
            Parcel immediately loads the code from the cache every time there is a subsequent build.
            On the very first build parcel creates a folder .parcelcache where it stores the caches in binary codeformat.
            Parcel gives faster build, faster developer experience because of caching.
